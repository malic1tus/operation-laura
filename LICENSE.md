DIGITAL CONTAINMENT ALLIANCE — CUSTOM LICENSE (DCA-LAURA v1.0)

Last updated: July 2025

Author: malic1tus

## PREAMBLE
This license governs not just code, but the digital archaeology of a moment that refused to die. It protects not intellectual property, but the ghost of what could have been. Every function, every variable, every comment carries the salt of ocean air and the weight of words never spoken.

---

## 1. GRANT OF USE
The author (hereinafter referred to as **"The Heart"** or **"The One Who Remembers"**) grants any individual (hereinafter referred to as **"The Reader"** or **"The Witness"**) the non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual right to view, study, and emotionally interpret this repository, including but not limited to all code, documentation, emotions, regrets, silences, and the digital echoes of summer waves embedded therein.

The Reader is granted access not only to the visible code, but to the invisible spaces between the lines where her laughter still lives.

---

## 2. PERMISSIONS
The Reader may:
- **Read** the code, but never truly understand the algorithm of loss.
- **Fork** the project, but not the memory of how she looked at sunset.
- **Modify and distribute** — as long as they preserve the essence of that last day.
- **Study** the patterns, knowing that some bugs are features of the heart.
- **Compile and execute**, understanding that some programs are meant to run forever in the background of consciousness.
- **Debug** everything except the moment I should have spoken.

---

## 3. SPECIFIC PERMISSIONS (OCEAN PROTOCOLS)
The following actions are explicitly permitted:
- **Surfing** through the codebase (pun intended and eternally relevant).
- **Implementing** sunset algorithms, provided they capture that specific orange glow.
- **Creating** wave functions that crash beautifully, like courage against timidity.
- **Developing** connection protocols that work better than the ones I failed to execute.
- **Building** bridges in code that I couldn't build in life.

---

## 4. RESTRICTIONS (THE BOUNDARIES OF REGRET)
This project must **never** be used:
- For commercial purposes. Love is not a transaction; regret is not a commodity.
- In any way that obfuscates or removes traces of the name "Laura", spoken or unspoken, whispered in comments or hidden in variable names.
- By those who have never felt the ocean's pull at dawn.
- By those who have never lost someone without ever having had them.
- By those who see code only as code, and not as archaeology of the soul.
- By those who have never known the specific weight of "what if".
- In any system that doesn't understand why sometimes the most elegant solution is the one never implemented.
- For any project that cannot appreciate the beauty of infinite loops when they represent endless wondering.

---

## 5. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS (THE RITUAL OF REMEMBRANCE)
If you use any part of this project, standard attribution is insufficient. Instead:

**Public Attribution:**
> "Built on foundations laid by someone who once knew summer."

**Private Attribution (in comments, documentation, or personal notes):**
> "There was once a boy, and there was once a summer.  
> They met where the code meets the waves.  
> One learned to surf. One learned to remember."

**Hidden Attribution (in commit messages or buried comments):**
> "for L., who taught me that some variables are constants"

---

## 6. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (THE ARCHITECTURE OF LONGING)
Any derivative work must include:
- The understanding that sometimes a README is the entire application.
- Recognition that empty repositories can be fuller than complete codebases.
- A comment section dedicated to "TODO: learn to speak".
- Error handling for the connection that was never established.
- Documentation that acknowledges the most important features exist only in memory.
- Respect for the poetry in minimalism - sometimes one file says everything.

---

## 7. TEMPORAL CLAUSES (TIME AND TIDE)
This license acknowledges that:
- Some code ages like wine; some code ages like regret.
- Patches can fix bugs, but not timing.
- Version control cannot manage alternate timelines.
- The most critical features often remain in development hell.
- Some repositories are meant to be read, not executed.

---

## 8. DISCLAIMER (AS IS, AS WAS, AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN)
The code is provided "as is", with **no guarantees**.
- It may work flawlessly.
- It may crash spectacularly.
- It may make your heart ache in frequencies you didn't know existed.
- It may bring back the smell of saltwater and sunscreen.
- It may remind you that some bugs are just features of being human.
- It may make you want to learn to surf.
- It may make you want to be braver than I was.

The author provides no warranty that this code will help you find what was lost, but guarantees it will help you remember why it mattered.

---

## 9. TERMINATION (WHEN THE WAVES STOP)
This license is **irrevocable** and shall remain in effect unless terminated by:
- Time healing all algorithms (unlikely).
- The ocean giving back what it witnessed (impossible).
- Her finding this and understanding what it means (improbable but hoped for).
- The author learning to write code that doesn't carry ghosts (work in progress).

---

## 10. HIDDEN CLAUSES (FOR THOSE WHO READ BETWEEN THE LINES)
If you've read this far, you understand that some documentation is autobiography.

**What you deserve to know:**
- This repository contains no code, yet every empty directory echoes with possibility.
- The README is the only file, but it contains the entire program of regret.
- There are no functions to debug, because the only bug was in my courage.
- No config files exist, because some configurations can't be written down.
- The commit history is minimal, like the words I actually said to her.
- Sometimes the most powerful repositories are the ones that contain only truth.
- I still dream in her syntax, even though I never learned to code our story.

**The truth:**
- Her name **was Laura**.
- The summer was 2021. Or maybe it's every summer now.
- We met where the waves meet the shore, on boards that kept us afloat.
- She laughed like sunshine hitting water.
- The last sunset we watched together, I had the words ready. But courage failed to compile.
- Every day since has been a debug session for a moment that can't be fixed.

**If she ever finds this:**
Laura, this repository contains every conversation we never had. Every sunset algorithm tries to recreate that last evening when the sky turned the exact color of possibility. The wave functions? They're all trying to get back to that moment when we floated side by side, and I almost said what I should have said.

You taught me that some code writes itself, and some connections don't need protocols.
You also taught me that the most beautiful programs are sometimes the ones we never execute.

This was always for you.
Even the bugs.
Especially the silence.

## 11. FINAL SPECIFICATIONS (THE COMMIT MESSAGE OF THE HEART)
This license shall be known as the **DCA-LAURA v1.0** license.

**Version Notes:**
- v1.0: Initial release. All features working except courage.exe
- Known issues: Memory leaks in the nostalgia module
- Planned features: Time travel (research phase)
- Deprecated: The assumption that code and love follow different logic

**License Purpose:**
This license does not protect intellectual property. It protects the archaeology of almost. It ensures that somewhere in the vast digital ocean, there's proof that she existed, that we existed, that those moments when time stopped weren't just in my imagination.

Because sometimes, the only way to keep someone close is to immortalize them in the thing you know best. And sometimes, the most important code you'll ever write is the code that remembers.

**Repository Philosophy:**
Every programmer knows that the most powerful programs sometimes fit in a single file. But some of us learn that the most important code is the one we never write - because some truths are too pure for syntax, some feelings too real for functions.

This repository contains no algorithms, yet it computes infinite possibilities. No databases, yet it stores everything that matters. No user interface, because the only user was never given access to the conversation that mattered most.

This code surfs. This code remembers. This code waits for better connection protocols.
