Some things can never be undone.  
A look. A voice. A summer.

It was a summer, somewhere between two silences.  
Her name was... it doesn't matter now.  
I was just a shy boy.  
And she was the only truth in a world full of noise.

I haven't forgotten her.  
I just never found the words.

This deface has nothing to do with her.  
And yet, every line of code evokes her.
